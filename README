juife - Java User Interface Framework Extensions

by Grigor Iliev <gr.iliev@gmail.com>


This library provides APIs for common components and utilities
that are missing in the Java 2 Platform Standard Edition.

You may download the latest version of the library from
http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/juife/


Requirements
============

To use juife you need java version 1.5.0 or higher.

To build the library or the documentation you need
JDK version 1.5.0 or higher and the Ant tool (http://ant.apache.org/).


Compilation
===========

Notice that the package contains both the source and the binary files.
So you can skip this section unless you want to rebuild the library or
you are using version downloaded from cvs.
 
To build the library or documentation follow the next steps.

  1. Set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to point to your JDK directory.
     If the JDK is installed in /opt/jdk1.5.0 directory, this can be done
     with the following command:

     export JAVA_HOME=/opt/jdk1.5.0

     (Windows users must do something like `set JAVA_HOME=c:\jdk1.5.0')

  2. Choose one or more of the following options.

     - Building the library (juife.jar): `ant build-lib'

     - Building the documentation: `ant build-doc'

     - Building all (library, documentation): `ant build-all'

     Also you may specify more then one target: `ant build-lib build-doc'


Installation
============

To install juife as an extension just copy juife.jar in the following directory:

<JDK-home>/jre/lib/ext

If you don't want to install juife as an extension, you may use the following
option when compiling or running an application that depends on it:

-cp .:/path/to/juife/juife.jar


Documentation
=============

The documentation is located in the doc directory.


Thanks for using juife.
